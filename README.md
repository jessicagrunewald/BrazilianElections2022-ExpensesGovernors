:computer: To access the necessary data, <strong>SQL</strong> queries were performed using the <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> tool.
<br>
<br>

#### Dashboard
The <strong>Microsoft PowerBI</strong> tool was used to clean and process the data, create relationships between tables and build the dashboard.
The dashboard seeks to answer the following items:
<ul>
   <li> Total expenses incurred by candidates for the position of governor</li>
   <li>The five parties with the highest expenditure figures</li>
   <li>The five sources of expenses with the highest values</li>
   <li> Candidates with the highest expense values</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, it is possible to filter specific information for each Shift, State and Party.<br><br>
